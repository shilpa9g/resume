I aim to return to workforce after dedicating 6 years to the joyful upbringing of my daughter as a full-time mother. I have previous experience as an apparel designer for 7 years and have most recently carved my path into UX Design with a certificate and relevant projects. I am passionate about design that solves problems. User experience design empowers me to truly understand the human behavior, the enablers and barriers, to better serve the people through more relevant products.
